## Reason for creation
To build a searchable employee directory with JavaScript for the Treehouse Techdegree FEWD program.

## What I did

JavaScript/jQuery drives the interactivity. Employee data retrieved with Fetch. This project matches the mockup provided. It's for large screens only.
 
## Backstory

This was another exercise in JavaScript. Fetch the employee data, display it and make it searchable. I discovered a kind of programming hell known as "formatting timestamps."
