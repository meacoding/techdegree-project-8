## Technologies and skills used 

+ HTML
+ CSS
+ JavaScript
+ jQuery


## Reason for creation
To build a searchable employee directory with JavaScript for the Treehouse Techdegree FEWD program.

## What I did

JavaScript/jQuery drives the interactivity. Employee data retrieved with Fetch. Matches provided mockup. For large screens only.
 
## Backstory

This was another exercise in JavaScript. Fetch the employee data, display it and make it searchable. I discovered a kind of programming hell which involves converting timestamps into formatted date and time.
